P1: Movie Trailer Website
Jerry Wardlow

This project generates an HTML website which displays information about movies
and plays their trailers.

Requirements:
Python 2 version 2.7.x

Using This Project:
The file jerrys_movies.py contains information about a number of my favorite
movies. It uses the files media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py to take this information
and generate an HTML website named jerrys_movies.html. By opening jerrys_movies.py,
the HTML file will be automatically generated and opened in a webbrowser. This is
done by using the Python Standard Library modules "webbrowser" and "os" to
generate a file and then open it in the users default webbrowser.
